So, how do you use the HttpClient (.NET)? Like this?

[code lang="csharp"]
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    var result = await client.GetAsync("http://xpto.com/api/stuff");
    //...
}
[/code]

Well, so do I. And it's **wrong**.

Check out [this article](http://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/08/2016-08-27-httpclientwrong/) that tells you all about why.
tl;dr
Use a singleton instance.
Oh, and after that one, [this](http://byterot.blogspot.pt/2016/07/singleton-httpclient-dns.html) is also a good (important) related read.
(You'll see that this second article makes my tl;dr a bit too short)
