Haven't shared anything in a while, but that doesn't mean I'm not up to something (I even recorded a video based on the [Docker + Angular + ASP.NET Core]({% post_url 2018-01-31-quick-intro-to-docker-and-docker-compose-angular-aspnetcore-postgres-app %}) post, but the sound turned out crappy and I scratched that).

To try to avoid these times I don't share something I created, I thought of starting a (hopefully) weekly "magazine" linking to some stuff I've been reading/watching.

## ["Procedural Programming: It's Back? It Never Went Away"](https://youtu.be/eEBOvqMfPoI)

Nice talk for some history on the nice things we get on our programming languages and always thing they're the latest and greatest, until we see the same concepts used in languages from before we were born :)

The talk is by [@kevlinhenney](https://twitter.com/kevlinhenney). Not the first I've seen of him, and they tend to be rather entertaining.
