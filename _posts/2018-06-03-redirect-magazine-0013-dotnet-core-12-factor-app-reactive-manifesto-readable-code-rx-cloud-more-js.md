# Articles
## ["Announcing .NET Core 2.1"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/30/announcing-net-core-2-1/)
.NET Core 2.1 is now final and here’s what it brings.
<br/>
## ["The Twelve-Factor App"](https://12factor.net/)
Nice set of guidelines on developing applications (focusing on SaaS). This is really far from new, but I only recently got around to reading the whole thing. By now most of what’s described sounds a bit obvious, but it’s good it’s written somewhere.
<br/>
## ["The Reactive Manifesto"](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
In the spirit of the previous article, another set of recommendations for application development, making them “reactive”. This has more of a focus on distributed systems and how the various components should interact.

# Videos
## ["Ready for Readable Code? - John Papa"](https://youtu.be/56mETnrByBM)
Focused on Angular but applies to pretty much any technology, some tips to get readable code.

## ["Cloud-Scale Event Processing with the Reactive Extensions (Rx) - Bart De Smet"](https://vimeo.com/132192255)
Really nice talk on using Rx (.NET) in cloud scenarios, showing a bunch of really cool stuff like composing an event stream query locally to run in the cloud.

## ["ASYNC + AWAIT (or How To Write Syncronous Looking Code, Without The Wait)"](https://youtu.be/BDqZLfBFeGk)
Using async await in JavaScript (very similar to .NET).
