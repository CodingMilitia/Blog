## ["Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar"](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/)
Interesting read on an implementation of a microservice architecture that went wrong, and a come back to a monolithic approach that worked. Maybe the microservices approach was not the best one, maybe it wasn't just well implemented or adequate for the problem at hand, but it's an important lesson that sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't an a monolith is just fine.

## ["Dolls and Maquettes"](https://www.amihaiemil.com/2018/04/17/dolls-and-maquettes.html)
Some thoughts on the way we tend to implement our applications, supposedly in an object oriented way, but basing everything on models and services to act on those models, we're more in a procedural realm really.

## ["System.IO.Pipelines: High performance IO in .NET"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/09/system-io-pipelines-high-performance-io-in-net/)
Another walk-through of Pipelines in .NET Core, to get a hold on writing IO code with these newer APIs.

## ["Here's Why Your Static Website Needs HTTPS"](https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/)
Troy Hunt continues trying to make everyone realize every site, have it sensitive information or not, should use HTTPS (for some obscure reason, some people are still fighting the idea). The main part of the explanation is in a video, but as the articles adds some info, I'm sharing the whole article instead of embedding the YouTube video as usual.
