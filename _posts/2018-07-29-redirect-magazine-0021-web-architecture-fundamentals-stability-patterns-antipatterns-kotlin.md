Not a big list this week, as I've been working on my own posts most of the time. Hopefully I'm able to get them published by tomorrow.

# Articles
## ["Web Architecture 101"](https://engineering.videoblocks.com/web-architecture-101-a3224e126947)
Nice article on a typical system's main architecture components. Maybe a given for more senior developers, but I find it an interesting quick intro for less experienced ones.

# Videos
## ["GOTO 2016 â€¢ Stability Patterns & Antipatterns â€¢ Michael T. Nygard"](https://youtu.be/VZePNGQojfA)
Very interesting talk on systems stability and availability, some examples of weird things that happened from the speaker's experience, some patterns and anti-patterns.

## ["How to Kotlin - from the Lead Kotlin Language Designer (Google I/O '18)"](https://youtu.be/6P20npkvcb8)
Cool talk on Kotlin and how to take advantage of its more terse syntax compared to Java (and even C#). It's on my to try list for quite a bit, I'll eventually try it ðŸ˜‹
