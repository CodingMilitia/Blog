My name is João Antunes (but I'll respond to Johnny or John). I work as a software engineer, mostly with .NET technologies, but I like to play around with other tech as well. I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (didn't you notice something familiar about the site title?) and am found regularly ranting about something :)
