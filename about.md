My name is JoÃ£o Antunes (but I'll respond to Johnny or John). I work as a software engineer, mostly with .NET technologies, but I like toÂ play around with other tech as well. My main interests are software architecture, design and development, with more focus on the backend but with a view of the whole stack.

I'm also a supporter of remote work, as I believe our industry is in a privileged position to provide the best work-life balance, skipping unneeded commutes and relocations.

Outside the programming world, I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (didn't you notice something familiar about the site title?) andÂ am found regularly ranting about something ðŸ™‚

Feel free to drop a comment, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joaofbantunes) or if you prefer [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaofbantunes), I'm always open for a chat.
If you're a younger/less experienced developer, and would like some advice, mentoring or just think I can help you out with something, reach out, I'll do my best to assist.
