## About me

Hey folks! My name is JoÃ£o Antunes and I work as a software engineer, mostly with .NET technologies, but I like to play around with other tech as well.

My main interests are software architecture, design and development, with more focus on the backend but with a view of the whole stack.

I love to explore new technologies, dig up some fringe topics and dive into over-engineering sessions, but always trying not to forget the basics and how they're essential to everything else.

I'm also a supporter of remote work, as I believe our industry is in a privileged position to provide the best work-life balance, skipping unneeded commutes and relocations.

Outside the programming world, I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (didn't you notice something familiar about the site title?) andÂ am found regularly ranting about something ðŸ™‚

Feel free to drop a comment, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joaofbantunes) or if you prefer [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaofbantunes), I'm always open for a chat.
If you're a younger/less experienced developer, and would like some advice, mentoring or just think I can help you out with something, reach out, I'll do my best to assist.

In 2019, I was awarded as a Microsoft MVP, in the developer technologies category.

## Other content

Besides this blog, I also use a couple of other mediums where I publish content: a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/CodingMilitia) and a [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/joaofbantunes).

I'll leave a couple of examples below.

## About the blog

Blog created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to try to hide my lack of design skills, code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CodingMilitia/Blog) and the generated assets served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### About the name

As widely known in the software development business, naming is hard! ðŸ˜€

Due to this indisputable fact, when I was trying to come up with a name for the blog, something more easily remembered than my name, particularly for non-portuguese speakers, I turned to one of my favorite things: heavy metal music. I jotted down some names from songs and albums, to try and think if I could adapt to the context of coding. One of the names that came up was [Metal Militia](https://youtu.be/sdGrxMKKHbo), a song by [Metallica](https://www.metallica.com/), and that's where Coding Militia came from ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤˜.

{{< yt sdGrxMKKHbo >}}
<br/>

And the logo that you'll see in some places, like the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/CodingMilitia), is also Metallica inspired.
