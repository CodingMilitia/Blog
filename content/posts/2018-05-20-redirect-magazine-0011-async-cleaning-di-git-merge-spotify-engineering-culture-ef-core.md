Had to get into some last minute reading to have enough links to share, but here they are! :)

# Articles
## ["Task, Async Await, ValueTask, IValueTaskSource and how to keep your sanity in modern .NET world"](https://blog.scooletz.com/2018/05/14/task-async-await-valuetask-ivaluetasksource-and-how-to-keep-your-sanity-in-modern-net-world/)
Starting with some history and getting into the latest additions, a nice little intro into the asynchronous features in .NET.

## ["Tame Your Giant, Beastly Dependency Injection Registration Class and Ride It Into Glorious Victory "](https://dev.to/scotthannen/tame-your-giant-beastly-dependency-injection-registration-class-and-ride-it-into-glorious-victory-am)
Some recommendations on taking care of the dependency injection configuration code.

## ["How to Use Git Merge [the Correct Way] "](https://dev.to/neshaz/how-to-use-git-merge-the-correctway-25pd)
Introductory article on using Git merge. Although I normally also develop using feature branches, I'd like to add that some prefer avoiding it, as sometimes the merges can be a pain when there are conflicts. Using other strategies like feature toggles can be useful. The video I added below about Spotify's engineering culture mentions this, as well as some comments on the article.

# Videos
## ["Spotify Engineering Culture Full Video (Agile Enterprise Transition with Scrum and Kanban)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2o-Xm3UVjs)
Very cool video on Spotify's engineering culture a colleague shared some time ago, but I only remembered to add to the magazine today, when reading the article on Git merge.

## ["Entity Framework Core 2.1: Simple, Powerful Data Access for .NET : Build 2018"](https://youtu.be/k55kDH_ixrQ)
A look at what's new in Entity Framework Core 2.1 (including some sweet performance improvements) and what's next.
