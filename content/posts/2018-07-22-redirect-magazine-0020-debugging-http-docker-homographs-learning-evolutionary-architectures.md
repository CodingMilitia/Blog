Been reading through my saved posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to), so the source for today is mostly that.

# Articles
## ["Intercept HTTP traffic exiting a docker container"](https://dev.to/jandedobbeleer/intercept-http-traffic-exiting-a-docker-container-3g68)
Nice example on how to intercept HTTP and HTTPS requests coming from a Docker container for debugging.
<br/>
## ["Homographs, Attack!"](https://dev.to/loganmeetsworld/homographs-attack--5a1p)
Had already seen some quick articles on these kinds of attacks where the URL for a page is not what it looks like, but this is a really good post explaining things in more depth.

## ["Learn New Technology as a Way of Stepping Up Your Understanding of Your Current One"](https://dev.to/ben/learn-new-technology-as-a-way-of-stepping-up-your-understanding-of-your-current-one-5hhm)
Nice point on learning different things in order to better grasp your main focus.

# Videos
## ["GOTO 2017 • Building Evolutionary Architectures • Patrick Kua"](https://youtu.be/8bEsNT7jdC4)
Interesting talk on architect a project for change, some anti patterns when doing it, and when does it make sense to do it versus a simpler approach.
