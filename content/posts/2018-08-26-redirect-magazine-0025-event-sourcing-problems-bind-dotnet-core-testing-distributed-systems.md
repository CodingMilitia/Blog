And we're in for another round!

# Articles
## ["What they don’t tell you about event sourcing"](https://medium.com/@hugo.oliveira.rocha/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-event-sourcing-6afc23c69e9a)
Nice read on some problems that might arise when using CQRS and event sourcing.

## ["Bing.com runs on .NET Core 2.1!"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/20/bing-com-runs-on-net-core-2-1)
Interesting to know how Bing is benefiting from .NET Core performance improvements. Even if you (and I) don’t like/use Bing, it’s still a massive project and a great way to see how .NET Core behaves at such scale.

# Videos
## ["Testing Distributed Systems w/ Deterministic Simulation by Will Wilson"](https://youtu.be/4fFDFbi3toc)
Really interesting talk (if a bit on the insane side) on creating deterministic simulations to test distributed systems.
Note: the sound on the video has some issues, but it's not too bad.
