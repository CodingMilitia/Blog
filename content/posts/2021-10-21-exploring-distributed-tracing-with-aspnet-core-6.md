Hey folks!

In this video, let's take a look at distributed tracing and how to get it working with ASP.NET Core 6.

Distributed tracing isn't a new subject by any means, but there are some more recent developments, namely in terms of standards like W3C Trace Context and OpenTelemetry, that are worth a look.
