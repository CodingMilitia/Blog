Hey folks!

Let's take a look at something that's been around for years, but maybe flew under the radar: NDepend, a static code analysis tool tailored for .NET.

It's not free, but it might be worth checking out, to see if your project would benefit from it. You can try it with the available 14-day trial (which was what I used to test it and record this video).
