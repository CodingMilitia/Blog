Hey folks!

Wanted to very briefly share a tool I've come across a couple of months ago: DevToys.

It centralizes in one app a bunch of tools commonly useful when developing software. It's unfortunately Windows only (at least for now), but it's pretty cool and you should give it a go if you work on Windows.

Additionally, it's open source and built with .NET, so you can also contribute if you're up for it!

For non-Windows alternatives check out the links below.
