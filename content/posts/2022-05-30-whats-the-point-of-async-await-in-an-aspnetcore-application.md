Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“¢ New one available through the tubes!

I've been noticing in recent chats that folks have difficulty explaining why do we use async/await, tasks and related, when building ASP.NET Core applications.

I hope that this video, very high-level and narrowly focused by design, can help in increasing the understanding of the importance of using these features.
