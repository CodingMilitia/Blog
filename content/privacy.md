(I don't even know if I really need to add this section, but it won't harm)

This blog is as basic as it can get, being a statically generated site that just presents the articles I write and commit to GitHub in this [repo](https://github.com/CodingMilitia/Blog).

I do however use some third party stuff to help getting this up and running so, a quick list:

## Netlify
I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build the blog from the GitHub repo and host it on their servers.

As to what concerns data by this blog's visitors, as mentioned by Netlify [here](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr/), the access logs containing the IP addresses are kept for less than 30 days.

## Google Analytics
Just to know if someone is actually visiting the site (and of course some other insights) I use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).

The default setting for [data retention](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196) currently defaults to 26 months. I only see aggregate data (like number os visitors, visits by time, visitors countries, more stuff like that), everything else is handled by Google.

## Disqus
I have [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) setup on the blog to allow for comments. When using the comments Disqus will keep some data it needs to handle that, to which I have no control over, but having a Disqus account you can handle it directly with them. I only see the same public facing comments everyone else sees when visiting the blog.

## GitHub
Besides using [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the projects I usually talk about here, I use it to host some code snippets using the provided widgets, so GitHub might also collect some info on this.

## YouTube
I embed some [YouTube](https://youtube.com) videos, some I record and others by third parties. Again, due to using the provided widgets, Google might collect some info regarding these videos.
