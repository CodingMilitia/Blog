(I don't even know if I really need to add this section, but it won't harm)

This blog is as basic as it can get, being a statically generated site that just presents the articles I write and commit to GitHub in this [repo](https://github.com/CodingMilitia/Blog).

I do however use some third party stuff to help getting this up and running so, a quick list:

## Netlify

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build the blog from the GitHub repo and host it on their servers.

As to what concerns data by this blog's visitors, as mentioned by Netlify [here](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr/), the access logs containing the IP addresses are kept for less than 30 days.

## Plausible Analytics

Just to know if someone is actually visiting the site (and of course some other insights) I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible is privacy focused, so it doesn't collect personal data, targeting the minimum amount of data needed to analyse a site's traffic. More information about data policy on [Plausible's web site](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

## GitHub

Besides using [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the projects I usually talk about here, I sometimes use it to host some code snippets using the provided widgets, so GitHub might also collect some info on this.

## YouTube

I embed some [YouTube](https://youtube.com) videos, some I record and others by third parties. Again, due to using the provided widgets, Google might collect some info regarding these videos.
